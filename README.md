### 👋 Hi there! 
I'm Diana, currently a Fourth Year IT student 💻 at UPV. I was always interested in technology and life itself took care of putting me in this place. My place. Where I'm trying to learn as much as possible every day. Step by step. I like things with cinnamon, tv shows and having fun but if one quote would describe me better, it would be that Nothing great in the world has ever been accomplished alone. Let's play!

⚡ Fun fact: Mi mother called me Diana because of her:
